    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hey everyone! My name is Nabilah Siddiqui and I am a third-year computer science student at the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT). I'm really grateful to be a part of the IIT community because it has essentially allowed me to develop my leadership skills and become a leader who could provide both academic coaching and mentoring to my Illinois Tech peers.</p>
    <p>As someone who wants to make a positive change on campus, I aspire to help and support others around me at Illinois Tech.</p>
    <p>I definitely look forward to connecting and meeting with new individuals throughout the semester!</p>

    <h2>Passions</h2>
    <p>Due to schoolwork, I have not had much time to explore my passions. However, in my free time, I really enjoy expanding my knowledge pertaining to my religion & personal identity. By gaining more knowledge and questioning myself about my short-term & long-term goals, I feel like I have found my purpose in life. In addition, I want to be able to use my knowledge and expertise to incorporate more women into Cybersecurity, which is why I am a part of WiCyS. I am really passionate about this org and excited to see what changes it may bring to Illinois Tech! Apart from school, I believe that I have a strong passion for nature, so I enjoy filming outdoor scenery whenever I get the chance. Here's a gorgeous video that I took from a family hike a while back during the summer (PS: no filters were used in this video!!):</p>
