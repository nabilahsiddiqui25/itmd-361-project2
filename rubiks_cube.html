    <h2>1974</h2>
    <p>Erno Rubik created numerous prototypes and versions of the cube before completing his final design, the 3×3 Rubik’s Cube, in 1974. Constructed primarily out of wood, the cube was relatively large and had corners that had to be cut down due to its size. During the creation process, Rubik came to the realization that he was unable to solve the puzzle he had invented, and spent a month devising a solution.</p>
    <h2>1975</h2>
    <p>Erno Rubik was granted a patent for his invention, the "Magic Cube," in Hungary in 1975. For the subsequent five years, the puzzle was known by this name until it was later renamed after Rubik himself.</p>
    <h2>1977</h2>
    <p>Late in 1977, the cube was introduced and made available for purchase in toy stores throughout Budapest, Hungary. The initial version of the cube was designed to be durable and not easily disassembled or broken, making it an ideal toy for children.</p>
    <h2>1979</h2>
    <p>Global distribution of the cube was delayed by a total of four years after Erno Rubik received his patent, largely due to the "Iron Curtain" that separated Europe and the difficulties it presented for international trade at the time. The decline of communism eventually made worldwide distribution possible.</p>
    <h2>1980</h2>
    <p>The Rubik's Cube was unveiled on a global scale at toy fairs around the world in early 1980, although slight modifications were necessary to comply with Western packaging and safety regulations.</p>
    <p>At this point, the name of the puzzle was also changed to honor its inventor, resulting in the official birth of the Rubik's Cube.That same year, David Singmaster developed and published the first layer-by-layer method for solving the cube. This method has remained popular and is still used by many puzzle enthusiasts and beginning speedcubers today.</p>
    <h2>1981</h2>
    <p>The Rubik's Cube was honored with the UK Toy of the Year award in both 1980 and 1981. In its first three years on the market, the puzzle sold a staggering 100 million units, and today it has sold over three times that amount, securing its place as the best-selling toy in history.</p>
    <p>Patrick Bossert also achieved success in 1981 with the publication of his book, "You Can Do The Cube," which provided readers with step-by-step instructions for solving the Rubik's Cube. The book went on to sell an impressive 1.5 million copies.</p>
    <h2>1982</h2>
    <p>The first Rubik's Cube World Championship took place in Hungary's capital city in 1982, featuring 20 contestants who had previously won smaller competitions in their home countries. The objective was to solve the Rubik's Cube as quickly as possible, and the winner was an American teenager named Minh Thai, who solved the cube in an impressive 22.95 seconds. Thai later authored a book titled "The Winning Solution," which not only detailed his championship-winning strategy but also taught others how to solve the Rubik's Cube. Some people still use the Ortega Corners-First method, which was inspired by Thai's book.</p>
    <p>Over the next couple of decades, as the world became increasingly engrossed in other toys and technologies, the Rubik's Cube gradually faded from the public eye. Though it continued to sell well, the excitement that surrounded its early years had all but dissipated. Nevertheless, the puzzle made occasional appearances in the news, such as with the creation of the most expensive Rubik's Cube in the world, the $1.5 million Masterpiece Cube by Diamond Cutters Int. During this time, speedcubing emerged as a new phenomenon, breathing new life into the Rubik's Cube.</p>
    <h2>1997</h2>
    <p>In 1997, Jessica Fridrich shared her approach to solving the Rubik's Cube on the internet. Her technique, called the Fridrich method (also known as CFOP due to its four stages), is now recognized as the most effective method for speedcubing. Fridrich's solvers have held the world record single and average times for many years, even though Fridrich initially believed that her method would not lead to consistent times under 13 seconds.</p>
    <h2>2003</h2>
    <p>The year 2003 saw the establishment of the World Cube Association by Ron Van Bruchem and Tyson Mao, which became the first governing body responsible for organizing official speedcubing competitions and overseeing national and global achievements. With the help of the WCA, speedcubing grew exponentially and reached many new countries. The WCA is now widely recognized as the official association for speedcubing, and all potential world records must comply with their regulations and oversight to be officially recognized.</p>
    <p>It was during this year that the second World Championship was held, with Dan Knight emerging as the winner with a time of 20.00 seconds.</p>
    <h2>2005</h2>
    <p>In 2005, the Rubik's Cube marked its 25th anniversary and a special edition cube packaging was produced to commemorate the occasion. The third Rubik's Cube World Championship was also held in the same year, which saw Jeans Pons emerge as the winner with a time of 15.10 seconds.</p>
    <h2>2014</h2>
    <p>The year 2014 marked the 40th anniversary of the Rubik's Cube's invention in 1974. To commemorate the occasion, an interactive Rubik's Cube doodle was featured on the front page of Google, while the Liberty Science Center in New Jersey opened the Beyond Rubik's Cube Exhibition. This exhibition showcased a variety of cube-related items, including robots capable of solving the puzzle and wooden prototypes from Rubik's early days. Additionally, the venue hosted the 2014 US National Rubik's Cube competition.</p>
    <h2>2015</h2>
    <p>Lucas Etter achieved a groundbreaking feat at an official WCA competition by setting a new world record for the Rubik's Cube single with a remarkable 4.90 solution time, marking the first instance of a record being broken under the sub-5 second threshold.</p>
    <h2>2018</h2>
    <p>Yusheng Du accomplished a remarkable feat by setting a new Rubik's Cube single world record with an impressive time of 3.47 seconds, which is 0.75 seconds faster than the previous record set by Feliks Zemdegs. It remains to be seen if this unbeatable record will be broken in the future.</p>
